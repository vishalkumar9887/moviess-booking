## 🏗️ Architecture

### Backend (Spring Boot)
```
├── Controllers (REST endpoints)
├── Services (Business logic)
├── Repositories (Data access)
├── Entities (Database models)
├── DTOs (Data transfer objects)
├── Security (JWT + Spring Security)
└── NLP Service (Voice processing)
```

### Frontend (React)
```

└── Voice Agent (Speech integration)
```

## 🎤 Voice AI Implementation

### Supported Intents
- `book_ticket`: Process movie ticket bookings
- `ask_showtimes`: Query movie showtimes
- `cancel_booking`: Handle booking cancellations
- `greet`: Handle greetings and help requests

### Sample Conversations
```
User: "Book 2 tickets for Avatar tomorrow 7pm"
Agent: "Great! I found 2 seat(s) for Avatar on Sep 16, 2025 at 7:00 PM at PVR Phoenix Pune. Would you like to proceed with booking?"
User: "Yes"
Agent: "Please provide card details." (redirects to payment)
```

### NLP Processing
- **Frontend**: Web Speech API for voice capture and synthesis
- **Backend**: Rule-based parser with regex patterns and date parsing
- **Fallback**: Text input when voice is not supported

## 💳 Payment Flow

### Mock Payment Process
1. **Card Details**: User enters test card information
2. **OTP Request**: System generates OTP token
3. **OTP Verification**: User enters `123456` for testing
4. **Confirmation**: Booking status updated to PAID
5. **Receipt**: User receives booking confirmation

### Test Credentials
- **OTP**: Always use `123456`
- **Card Details**: Any test card numbers accepted
- **Demo User**: `demo@movie.com` / `Password123`

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Core Entities
- **Users**: Authentication and profile data
- **Movies**: Movie information and metadata
- **Showtimes**: Screening details and availability
- **Bookings**: Reservation records and status
- **Payments**: Transaction tracking and OTP tokens

### Seed Data
- 5 movies (Avatar, Inception, Dune, Spider-Man, Interstellar)
- Multiple showtimes across 2 theaters
- Demo user account for testing

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Development
```bash
# Quick start
./run.sh

# Manual start
